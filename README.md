pysettrie
=========

SetTrie is a pure-python module that provides support for efficient storage and querying of sets of sets using the trie data structure, supporting operations like finding all the supersets/subsets of a given set from a collection of sets.  The following classes are included: SetTrie: set-trie container for sets; supports efficient supersets/subsets of a given search set calculations. SetTrieMap: mapping container using sets as keys; supports efficient operations like SetTrie but also stores values associated to the key sets.
